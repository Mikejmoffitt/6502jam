Windjammers Physics Notes (Original)
===================================

Throws:
* Decaying velocity coefficient until player presses button
* If CW/CCW turn is detected on joystick right before throw, the sinusoidal
  effect is enabled until the disc collides with a wall
* If a special move is caught and returned quickly, the same move is returned
* The disc pushes the player back a little on catch for a strong or special
* Player pushback may be canceled by throwing a button
* When the disc is popped up in the air, the destination target distance range
  is determined by how close the player's timing was
* A lob or super-lob's destination is determined in the Y axis with the player
  joystick, and in the X axis by how long the player has waited (decaying
  counter tending closer to the net)
