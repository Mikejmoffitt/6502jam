SICK TASK MANAGEMENT
====================

* D-Pad rotation sense
* Angle influence on disc path (after angle throw)
	- Use arctan to get angle disc currently travels at 
	- Use distance formula to get speed disc currently travels at 
	- Add / sub from angle
	- Use cos and sin to get coefficients for new dx / dy
	- Multiply coefficients by stored disc speed
* Disc deflection / flip up
* Super throws (when disc comes back down)
* Scoring detection
* Title screen
* Music
